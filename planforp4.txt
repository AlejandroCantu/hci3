Default is still Houston, Dallas, and Austin.

Max 6(?) cities.

Allow users to add cities.

Save that.

Retrieve user data upon log in.

Maybe have dropdown for city list????
That would make the formatting easier (or nonexistant)
Also, would make the limit practically nonexistant

Change the search bar to city search and keep search button while adding an "add" button, which would add the city to the list of cities (keep coordinates to use with Open-Meteo)


Make sure users can create new accounts.

Add Firebase to your web app

Run:

npm install firebase

Then, initialize Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products you'd like to use.

// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyBXJWfoOa4zXC8i-xJyADFYUC3C9JOq6bQ",

  measurementId: "G-WGD31D1BXE"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
